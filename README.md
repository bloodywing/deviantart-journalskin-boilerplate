# This is a Journal Skin Skeleton

## Preparation

Since this uses less and gives you the option to compile that to css I
recommend you install a less compiler.
Check the official website http://lesscss.org

### How to use this

1. Edit the file [skin.less](skin.less)
2. Compile it to css
3. open `journal-skeleton.html` in your browser
4. Looks good? Upload the content of `skin.css` to DeviantArt

### Less sucks, I don't want to use it

You can simply use plain css by creating a `skin.css` file and edit that without
touching `skin.less`

### I've found some CSS examples on DeviantArt and they don't work with your skeleton, why?

My Skeleton uses the "new" Journal skin, and a lot of examples on the site are with the old Journal Markup
like the popular Hero skin.

### Why are there head-html and footer.html

You can add a header and footer on DeviantArt to your Skin, you'll see those 2 fields when editing a skin on DA
The 2 html files are automatically included in the journal-skeleton via ajax.
